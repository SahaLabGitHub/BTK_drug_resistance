# BTK_drug_resistance input files
This contains input parameter files that were used in Gromacs 2023
For example, minimization input, equilibration and production run input files.
gmx_MMPBSA input files used for MM-PBSA and MM-GBSA. 
Since the same files were used for all the WT and MT complexes we are providing only for one system.
